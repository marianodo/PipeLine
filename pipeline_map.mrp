Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                 3,058 out of  18,224   16%
    Number used as Flip Flops:               3,029

    Number used as AND/OR logics:               29
  Number of Slice LUTs:                      4,586 out of   9,112   50%
    Number used as logic:                    4,584 out of   9,112   50%
      Number using O6 output only:           3,968
      Number using O5 output only:              36
      Number using O5 and O6:                  580
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      2
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         2
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                     1,112 out of   4,556   24%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        6,146
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         3,098 out of   6,146   50%
    Number with an unused LUT:               1,560 out of   6,146   25%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       1,488 out of   6,146   24%
    Number of unique control sets:              17
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              43 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
